# Lecture 3.5 - Constructors - Introduction
So far, we have constructed new instances of objects from our homemade class `Walrus`. We have seen how we can instantiate `Walrus`-type objects, and how they will receive field values depending on how we set up our `Walrus` class. We have also seen how we can use getters and setters to modify existing fields in order to e.g. change the `name` or `age` of a walrus. This way is quite cumbersome though, wouldn't it would be much easier if we could specify the values of these fields already when we create our walrus objects? Imagine if we could create our `Walrus` object using this kind of call:

```
Walrus abraham = new Walrus(age=14, name="Abraham", weight=165.4);
``` 

Well, it turns out that we can! (what a surprise, eh?).

## Default constructor
To do this, we make use of a special type of method called a <i>constructor</i>. A constructor is a method with no return value (not even `void`!) that always takes the same name as its parent class. In our case, our constructor would look like this:

![defaultConstructor](/assets/lecture_4/defaultConstructor.PNG)

This is the <i>default constructor</i>, identifiable as such by it having no input arguments. The default constructor is actually automatically called upon when you create a new instance of an object and don't use any input arguments. You don't need to specify a default constructor, Java does so for you. But you can modify the body of the default constructor to include extra things other than just creating the object:

![defaultConstructorPrint](/assets/lecture_4/deafultConstructorPrint.PNG)

Here, we have added the extra functionality of printing a statement to terminal when a new `Walrus`object is created. 

We can also set the value of fields in the default constructor:

![defaultChangeField](/assets/lecture_4/defaultChangeField.PNG)

![defaultChangeFieldOutput](/assets/lecture_4/defaultChangeFieldOutput.PNG)

See how the default constructor statement `age = 0;` assigned a new value to the `age` field, and our new walrus object now has an age of 0. This is often utilized to set default parameters of objects. We can change our initial declarations of our parameters in our `Walrus` class to not include any assignment, and instead assign them default values in our default constructor:

## General constructors
The default constructor is automatically used when your object creation call has no input arguments. If you do want to be able to assign values to object fields, then a general constructor is useful. Let's continue with our `Walrus` class. It would be very useful if we, at object creation, could decide e.g. the name of the Walrus, such that not all walruses are named Abraham. We do this by creating a <i>second constructor</i> that takes a `String` argument for the `name` field:

![constructorName](/assets/lecture_4/constructorName.png)

![constructorNameOutput](/assets/lecture_4/constructorNameOutput.png)

Here, when we create a new instance of `Walrus` and add a `String`-type argument, Java will choose the constructor that takes a `String`-type argument and use that constructor to create the new walrus object. Our String-constructor assigns the input argument `name` to our created object via `this.name = name`, and the walrus object is consequently created with our specified name instead of the default name. Note that the default constructor still exists, such that if we provide no arguments, then it still uses the name given in the default constructor.

Let's design a constructor that takes input arguments for all three characteristics of our walrus:

![constructorFull](/assets/lecture_4/constructorFull.png)

![constructorFullOutput](/assets/lecture_4/constructorFullOutput.png)

There, now we have created a general constructor where we can define all of our object fields upon creation. We now have three ways of instantiating `Walrus` objects, we can either call on our default constructor `Walrus()` to create a Walrus from our default values, we can use our String-argument constructor `Walrus(String name)` to create named walruses with default age and weight, or we can use the full constructor `Walrus(int age, String name, double weight)` to assign all of the characteristics of our newly created `Walrus` object. Creating multiple constructors in this way is called <i>constructor chaining</i>.

### This
We can use the `this` keyword in constructors to refer to another constructor: 

![constructorOverloaded](/assets/lecture_4/constructorOverloaded.png)

In the above example, we have rewritten our String-argument constructor so that it uses `this()`. The output of this type of constructor is exactly identical to our String-argument constructor earlier, just in fewer lines of code. Instead of assigning all of the default variables, we use `this()` to call on our full constructor. This practically means that our String-argument constructor will immediately call on our full constructor, using our input `name` as argument. This kind of referring using `this()` can be especially useful if your constructor uses a lot of code, then you don't need to repeat that code just because you want constructors with different numbers of arguments. Imagine e.g. a situation like this:
```
Constructor(int a, int b) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;

    /* Tons 
    of 
    complicated 
    code
    */
}

Constructor(int a) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = 0;

    /* Tons 
    of 
    complicated 
    code
    */
}
```

Instead of doing the above and repeating the complex code, you can use a call to `this()`:

```
Constructor(int a, int b) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;

    /* Repettion 
    of the same
    complicated 
    code
    */
}

Constructor(int a) {
    this(a, 0);
}
```

Both these code segments have identical output, but it reduces the amount of clutter in your constructors. This is advanced for the course and not something you are required to understand, but it's a nifty way of reducing the amount of code needed.
