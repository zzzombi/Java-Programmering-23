# Lecture 8.1 - Try / Catch

A thrown exception is handled using a try / catch / (finally) statement. Syntactically, it works in the same way as an if/else-statement. First, the `try` keyword specifies the code block which is to be executed that could potentially throw an exception. Second, the `catch` keyword specifies a code block that is to be executed if the exception is thrown. Third, and optionally, the `finally` keyword specifies a code block to be executed after the exception handling procedure is complete.

### A simple example
Let's use a simple Array program as an example. First of all, accessing an Array throws only unchecked exceptions, meaning that we don't necessarily <b>need</b> to handle them, but perhaps we want to anyway! (Imagine for a second how annoying it would be if all Array declarations needed to be checked for exceptions!)

<pre><code>public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] myNumbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};

        int five = myNumbers[5];
    }
}
</code></pre>

The above program will will create an Array consisting of the numbers 0 thru 4. Then we try to access the element at position `5`, which does not exist (remember Arrays start from 0). This is highly contrived, but imagine that the `5` in this case comes from e.g. user input, which makes for a more sensible way of achieving this error. The failing Array access throws an exception (`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`), and the program crashes.

In order to avoid this, we enclose the Array access statement within a `try` clause:

<pre><code>public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] myNumbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};

        try {
            int five = myNumbers[5];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

Now, the program will not compile, since every `try` statement needs a consecutive `catch`-statement that determines what is going to happen if an exception is thrown. Let's add a `catch`-statement that catches the possible `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. From now we will omit the class declaration and the `main()` method for brevity.

<pre><code>int[] myNumbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};

try {
    int five = myNumbers[5];
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) { }
</code></pre>

Notice how the `catch` statement has a parentheses that takes arguments. It specifies the type of exception expected (`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`), and gives this particular exception-object a variable name (`e`). The `catch` code block is left empty at this point. Now, if we execute the program, it will run without crashing! Excellent!

### Using the Catch code block
In the `catch` code block, we can specify what we want to do if an exception is caught. We could for example include a simple printed error-message that informs the user that the accessed element did not exist:

<pre><code>int[] myNumbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};

try {
    int five = myNumbers[5];
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.err.println("Oops! That element did not exist!");
}
</code></pre>

Now, if an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exception is thrown, instead of crashing the program, the error message will be printed! We can do all kinds of things in the `catch` code block, such as error recovery, resetting the program state, asking the user for input on how to proceed, etc.
