# Lecture 2.6 - Classes - Methods
Methods are essential to Java. In fact, they are so essential, that we needed to define methods just to get here. In both our `HelloWorld` and our `HelloJava` program we defined methods. In these cases, our classes have used a single method; the special `main()` method. Often times however, a class will contain multiple methods.

A method (or as many other programming languages call them, a function) is a named, repeatable segment of code, that you can <i>call on</i> at any time. You don't necessarily have to use methods, but they can be very convenient. In the case of larger applications they are essential in order to keep track on what's going on. A method always exists <b>within a class</b>, but can have its own local variables (both primitive and reference type). 

## Defining a method
To define a method, you need two keywords: an <i>output type</i>, and a method <i>name</i>. Let's say I want to declare a method in our `Walrus` class, which causes our walrus friend to clap its front flippers. I can do this by typing `void clap() {}` inside the curly braces of my `Walrus` class. Let's fill out the body of the methods (the part within in the curly braces) with some code. This code will be executed every time you call on the method.

When we call upon this method, the code within the curly braces will be executed. In this case, we will make a simple print-out where the walrus claps its flipper. Notice the use of the `name` variable here to use the currently stored name of our walrus. If we now create a new object of our Walrus class (remember to save the .java source file, and re-open it in jshell), we can use our newly defined method!

## Calling on a method
Using a method is called <i>calling</i> on it. This is done by use of the now familiar dot operator (`.`). 

![methodCall](/assets/lecture_2/methodCall.PNG)

See how when we call on the `clap()` method, we get the printout "Abraham claps its flippers!". This is because we call on the `clap()` method to act on the `abraham` object (via the dot operator). We can try calling on the `clap()` method (or <i>invoking</i> which is sometimes also used) on an object of a different type and see what happens.

![callMethodSeal](/assets/lecture_2/methodCallSeal.PNG)

Notice how this produces an error. This is because `roland` is not a `Walrus` object, but rahter a `Seal` type object. And the `Seal` class does not have a `clap()` method (yet!). We can, however create multiple instances of the `Walrus` class, and always be able to invoke the `clap()` method.

![getSet1](/assets/lecture_2/getSet1.PNG)

Hmm, here we run in to a problem. We have created a new instance of our `Walrus` class, and referenced it by variable `roxanne`. However, when we invoke the `clap()` method, the name that gets printed out is `Abraham`. Of course, this is going to happen since we declared the name of our walrus as a field within the `Walrus` class. Every single time we create a new walrus type object, it will get the name `Abraham`. There are a few ways around this.

## Return and return types
Most methods produce a return value, which is specified by the `return` keyword. Our `clap()` method above didn't have any return value (we will get to that shortly), but many others will. E.g. we might want to construct a method that computes the age of a walrus in months instead of years. Such a function will return a numerical value, preferrably an `int`, since that's the data type for our `age` variable. Let's see what it might look like:

![computeAge](/assets/lecture_2/computeAge.PNG)

Two things are changed here compared to the `clap()` method. First, we have specified a <i>return type</i>: `int`. Second, we have specified the <i>return value</i>: `age * 12`. This means that the `computeAge()` method computes the age in months of a walrus by taking its current age (which is in years) and multiplying it by 12 to get the number of months. (Yes, this is a very crude way of calculating amount of months, but let's not focus on that now). Notice how here, the <i>return type</i> is `int`, since we are expecting the function to return an int. If the return type of the method does not match that of the `return` keyword, Java will try to convert to the return type. As long as this conversion is possible (e.g. `int` -> `double`) there will be no issues, but if the type conversion is not allowed, then the method will produce an error:

![returnTypes](/assets/lecture_2/returnTypes.PNG)

Notice in the above example how we can create a method with output `double` for our `computeAge()` method, as an integer can always be turned into a double. However, if we try to create a method with output `boolean`, the IDE gives us a warning that this will produce an error.

### Void
Now what was the point of that `void` keyword in front of our `clap()` method?

`clap()` utilizes a special return type: `void`, which means that the method doesn't return anything at all. This is useful when you just want the method to accomplish something without returning any value. That is, you are using the method just for its "side effects". Remember how our `main()` method in `HelloJava` also had `void` as return type? This is because `main()` is never supposed to produce any return value. `void` means that the method does not return anything (notice how this is different from returning e.g. `0` or an empty string `""`.)

## Input parameters (arguments)
We can also pass on variables to our method, by including them as <i>parameters</i>. Parameters are often called <i>arguments</i> in other programming languages, and  are supplied within the parentheses `()` block of the method call, and are defined in the method itself. Consider the following method:<br>

![arguments](/assets/lecture_2/computeArea.PNG)<br>

Here, the method `computeArea()` returns an integer `x * y`, i.e. the area of a rectangle. `x` and `y` in this case are the methods' <i>parameters</i>. Parameters are any variables that are passed into the method via the user. Parameters are declared in the same way as variables (in fact, they act as local variables inside the method) by specifying their <b>type</b> and <b>name</b>. In this case, we supply two arguments of type `int`: `x` and `y`. We can then use the parameters variables inside the method, and once the method is finished running, the variables will disappear.
