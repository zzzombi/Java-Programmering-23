# Lecture 3.4 - Classes - Access modifiers
 One of the key benefits of Java's object-oriented approach is the ability to restrict access to fields (and methods) in a class. When you construct classes for a complex application, it is often a good idea to keep class fields as restricted to members of its class. This makes it harder for an outsider (or more often, yourself making a mistake...) to make forbidden access to class fields and change stuff so that your application does not work as intended. In high-security applications this kind of access-restriction is completely necessary.

 Java provides a number of keywords that can be added to fields in order to modify their access. For now, let's focus on three of them: `public`, `private` and `protected`. You set the access modifier of a field by including it when you declare your field. `public int age = 14;` declares an integer variable named `age`, with the assigned value `14`, with `public` access.

 The default access setting for Java fields is `package-private` meaning that it is accessible for all members of the same package. `package-private` isn't an actual keyword, but is simply the visibility of a field without any modifier.

 ### Public fields
Public access means that the variable is accessible to anyone, regardless of scope. This means that the field value can be retrieved by any function inside or outside of the class. The rule of thumb is to keep most variables hidden from outside access, and use a method to retreive its value(s) instead. We will talk more about that later. For our simple `Walrus` class, it doesn't really matter though. Let's set the `age` and `name` fields as public.

In practice, this doesn't really change much for our use-case, as our `age` and `name` fields were already accessible to us in jshell.

### Private fields
Private access means that the field is accessible <b>only to the class itself</b>. This is a strong restriction, and actually means that not even a subclass (subclasses will come later!) can access it. Private fields are often used for variables that don't need to be shared around a lot. If a private field is to be shared or accessed, one can create a method to access it instead. Don't worry about that for now, we will do that later on when we get to methods.

Let's try to set one of our fields in our class as private. I decided to make the `weight` field private (after all, you don't ask a walrus about its weight!).

Now, this is where we actually change the functionality of our class! If we re-load it into jshell again, and try to read the value of our `weight` field, we are not allowed to!

This may seem overly complicated, why wouldn't I want anyone to read out the weight of Abraham? Well, turns out it's not just about walrus integrity and GDPR... Remember we allowed `public` access to the `name` field. This means that anyone can not only read, but also assign values to that field! Check out what happens if we assign a new value to the `name` field:

![publicAssign](/assets/lecture_2/publicAssign.PNG)

That was all perfectly allowed! We changed Abraham's name to Thelonius, what a breach of integrity! Well, if we try to do the same with the `weight` field, we will not be allowed to. All because we set the access modifier to `private` for that field.

Hopefully, you're starting to see the usefulness of keeping your class fields private. Not only does it mean that your fields are not read by someone who shouldn't, but most of all it means you will not modify them by mistake from the outside. Now, what if I <b>want</b> to change the weight of Abraham? Maybe he's gone through a couple of months of diet (more low-fat cod, less high-fat salmon!). To access a private variable, we typically use a <i>method</i>. We will create a method for accessing the weight of Abraham, but first, a quick word on the `protected` keyword.

### Protected fields
The `protected` modifier is the middle-way between `public` and `private`. It lets any subclass of the current class access the field. `protected` is useful when you want to provide fields to your subclasses, but not to the outside. Often times, `protected` is used for methods which are subsequently <i>overridden</i> by subclasses. Let's not delve too much into that, we haven't even gotten to methods yet!
