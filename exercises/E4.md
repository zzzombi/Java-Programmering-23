# Exercises - Lecture 4 - Methods

<ol>

<li> Create a Java class named MainMethodKeywords with the following structure:
<pre><code>
public class MainMethodKeywords {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("main is working fine!");
    }
}
</pre></code>

<ol type="a">
<li> Run the program and observe that it works as intended. </li>
<li> Modify the access modifier of the main() method to <code>private</code>. Observe the compiler error and explain the reason behind it. </li>
<li> Remove the <code>static</code> keyword from the main() method signature. Observe the compiler error and explain why the main() method requires the <code>static</code> keyword. </li>
<li> Change the return type of the main() method to <code>int</code>. Observe the compiler error and explain why the main() method must have return type <code>void</code>. </li>
<li> Change the parameter name of the main() method from "args" to "arguments." Does the program still work? </li>
<li> Modify the data type of the array in the main() method signature to something other than <code>String[]</code>. Observe the compiler error that occurs and explain why the parameter must be of type <code>String[]</code>. </li>
<li> Move the brackets (<code>[]</code>) from <code>String</code> to <code>args</code> (<code>(String args[])</code>). Does the program still run? </li>
</ol></li><br>

<li> Geometry<br> 
Create two classes: "Circle" and "Rectangle." The Circle class should have methods to calculate its area and circumference, while the Rectangle class should have methods to calculate its area and perimeter.  

In a separate class, named "GeometryTester," write a main method. Import the geometric classes, and create an object of both the Circle and Rectangle classes. Use the methods from each class to calculate and display the area and perimeter of a circle and rectangle of your choice.
</li><br>

<li> Mathematics<br>
Create a class called myMathMethods that holds a number of mathematical functions in separate methods. Write a main() method that tests your math functions and prints their output to terminal 

<ol type="a">
<li>
Factorial<br>
Write a method called calculateFactorial that takes an integer parameter and calculates its factorial. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. Test your method by calling it with different values and printing the results.

Hint: Use a special if-condition for the factorial of 0, which by definition is 1.
</li>

<li> Fibonacci <br>
Write a method called calculateFibonacci that takes an integer parameter and calculates the Fibonacci number at that position. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... If the input is 4, the method should return 2 (the Fibonacci number at position 4). Test your method by calling it with different values and printing the results.

Hint: Use a special if-condition for the first two positions!
</li>

<li> Prime checker <br>
Write a method called isPrime that takes an integer parameter and checks whether it is a prime number. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. If the number is prime, the method should return true; otherwise, it should return false. Test your method by calling it with different values and printing the results.

Hint: Make use of the modulus (<code>%</code>) operator.
</li>
</ol><br>

<li> String Manipulation <br>
Create a class called myStringMethods that holds a number of string-related functions in separate methods. Write a main() method that tests your functions and prints their output to terminal. 

<ol type="a">
<li> Reversing <br>
Write a method called reverseString that takes a String parameter and returns the reversed version of the input string. For example, if the input is "Hello", the method should return "olleH". Test your method by calling it with different strings and printing the results.

Hint: Look up the <code>String</code> method <code>charAt()</code>!
</li>

<li> Character Count <br>
Write a method called countCharacters that takes a String parameter and a char parameter. The method should count and return the number of occurrences of the specified character in the given string. For example, if the input string is "Hello" and the character is 'l', the method should return 2. Test your method by calling it with different strings and characters, and printing the results.
<br>

<li> String Validation <br>
Write a method called isValidEmail that takes a String parameter representing an email address and checks whether it is a valid email format. The method should return true if the email address is valid, and false otherwise. Implement the validation logic by checking for the presence of an '@' symbol and a valid domain extension (e.g., ".com", ".org", ".edu"). Test your method by calling it with different email addresses and printing the results.

Hint: Make use of the <code>String</code> methods <code>indexOf()</code> and <code>endsWith()</code>.
